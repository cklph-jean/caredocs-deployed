# CareDocs Frontend (Expo - Android/iOS/Web)

## Prerequisite

1. Please ensure the Node.js version is `21.x.x`.
2. Following steps assume `yarn` is being used as package manager of choice. If not installed, you can install `yarn` globally as `npm i -g yarn`.
3. If you want to use npm directly, you can replace `yarn <command>` with `npm run <command>`.

## Local execution

1. From project root, run `yarn` or `npm install`.
2. If successfully installed, run `yarn start` to run the metro bundler.
3. To open in a browser, press `w` on the terminal window where metro bundler is running. Alternatively, running `yarn web` would do the same thing as Step 2 and 3 combined.
4. To open in Android, install `Expo Go` app from PlayStore and scan the QR code displayed in terminal.

_Note: Please ensure your phone on the same Wifi network as Laptop for Expo Go to work._
